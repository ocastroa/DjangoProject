# DjangoProject
The purpose of this web application was to learn how to build and deploy an application using the Django Framework. This web application is taken from the Udemy course, "Python Django Dev to Deployment", taught by Brad Traversy (https://github.com/bradtraversy/btre_project).
A basic Bootstrap 4 theme was used for html/css. Postgres was used for the database. The application was deployed to Digital Ocean using Gunicorn and Nginx. The domain is registered with namecheap.com.
